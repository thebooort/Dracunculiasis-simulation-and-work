## A mathematical model for the erradication of Guinea Worm Disease (with simulation by Bart Ortiz)
 This work is a brief revision and study about the research article **A mathematical model for the erradication of Guinea Worm Disease** by *Robert J. Smith, Patrick Cloutier, James Harriso and Alex Desforges.* My aim is to present its mains results, some technical highlights related to the mathematical proofs and comment about its implications and future research. Moreover** I present a brief translation into discrete models I made, to create a real time simulation that will be shown in the live presentation.**

 I include the tex files, code for the simulation and the slides

 Feel free to ask me about anything there.

 I made this work for my **math models in Ecology and Epidemiology** course.
